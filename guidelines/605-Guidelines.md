<p><strong><tt>General</tt></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Daily, we will be uploading learning modules in the form of PPTs, tutorials or practice questions&nbsp;by 8:30 am CET or 1 pm IST.</li>
	<li>The exercises given for self-practice need not be submitted anywhere, only the assignments need to be submitted. However, if you face any issues while attempting the self-practice questions, please feel free to drop your queries in the #help channel&nbsp;on Slack or on Discuss:&nbsp;<a href="https://discuss.dphi.tech/" target="_blank">https://discuss.dphi.tech/</a></li>
	<li>The learning modules&nbsp;of both the tracks&nbsp;will be made available for&nbsp;all after the Bootcamp ends. So if you&#39;ve enrolled in one track but are interested to learn things from the other, you can go through it at your own pace later!</li>
</ul>

	<li>The certificate is dependent on the completion of these assignments. The top 15% of the participants(in respective tracks) will get a Certificate of Excellence whereas the rest who are able to complete and submit all the assignments will obtain a Certificate of Acknowledgement.</li>
	<li>While we do encourage a healthy competition for the certificates, we promise that the things you learn along the way will be much more valuable. :)</li>
